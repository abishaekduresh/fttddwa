## Features

### Core
- **Public Home Page** — Fully animated, mobile-responsive landing page at `/`. Hero section with floating logos, animated ambient orbs, scroll-triggered stat counters, and staggered text entrance. Quick Access cards in Tamil (விரைவு அணுகல்) with gradient icon badges, shine-sweep hover effects, and IntersectionObserver-driven card entrance animations. Contact tiles slide in on scroll. All Quick Access text is in Tamil. Feature cards respect `enableMemberRegistration` and `enableIdCard` flags
- **Return-URL Preservation** — After session expiry or mid-session 401, users are redirected to `/login?next=<original-path>` and returned to the exact page after re-authentication. Middleware, dashboard layout, and `apiFetch` all cooperate to encode and restore the return path. Open-redirect protection ensures only internal paths are accepted
- **Member Management** — Add, edit, delete, search, and filter members with Tamil + English name support
- **Membership ID Generation** — Auto-generated IDs in format `FTTD{YY}{NNNNN}` (e.g. `FTTD260001`)
- **Wedding Date Tracking** — Record and display anniversary dates for all members
- **Public Self-Registration** — Members can register at `/members/register` (toggleable by admin); submitted records land as `PENDING` and require admin approval before becoming active
- **Member Approval Workflow** — Self-registered members start with `PENDING` status. Admins approve them with a one-click button in the members list, changing status to `ACTIVE`. Non-active statuses (PENDING, INACTIVE, SUSPENDED, EXPIRED) each produce a specific descriptive error on the ID card page
- **Member Status Toggle** — Admins can block/unblock members by toggling between `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` status directly from the members list
- **Member ID Card** — Public digital ID card system. Members verify identity at `/members/id-card` (Membership ID + phone); on success, they are redirected to a cryptographically signed, **single-use** PDF token URL that expires in 10 minutes. Card design features a modern portrait layout with automated validity calculation, digital signatures, and **full admin customization (colors, titles, visibility)**. Includes **dynamic vertical stacking** to prevent gaps when fields are missing, **multi-line wrapping** for long addresses, and **direct PDF sharing** from the dashboard. Supporting server-side **SVG-to-PNG rendering** for high-fidelity previews.
- **WhatsApp Module** — Automated + Manual messaging with multi-vendor support, fallback logic, and real-time status tracking; cron triggered via admin UI or external HTTP call (no worker required)
- **Membership Analytics** — Dashboard stats for membership growth and WhatsApp credit consumption
- **Photo Upload** — Secure passport-size photo upload with type + size validation; stored in local/persistent storage with environment-aware paths
- **Tamil Nadu Coverage** — All 38 districts and their taluks pre-loaded; "Others" option for custom districts
- **Export** — Download member data as formatted Excel (`.xlsx`)

### Authentication & Security
- JWT access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (7 days) in HttpOnly cookies
- `refresh_token` cookie scoped to `/api/auth` path — not sent on regular page requests
- Permissions embedded in JWT payload — `/api/auth/me` requires **zero DB queries**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — Super Admin, Admin, Data Entry Operator, Viewer
- Account lockout after 10 failed login attempts (5-min cooldown)
- Rate limiting: auth endpoints by IP (strict), authenticated APIs by user ID
- Idle-aware proactive token refresh; multi-tab debounce prevents duplicate DB hits
- `apiFetch` client utility — all dashboard API calls auto-refresh on 401, redirect to login with toast on session expiry
- Input sanitization (XSS protection via `sanitize-html`)
- Security headers via Next.js config (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS-ready)
- **HMAC-signed single-use PDF tokens** — stateless HMAC-SHA256 tokens verified across processes; DB unique-constraint enforces one-view-only; expired tokens cleaned up lazily

### Admin Dashboard
- Real-time stats — total members, district-wise distribution, monthly growth
- Recent member activity and audit event feed
- Role-gated UI (buttons/sections hidden based on permissions)
- **App Settings** — Toggle public member registration on/off (SUPER_ADMIN / ADMIN only)

### Audit & Compliance
- Full audit log of every create/update/delete/login action
- IP address and user agent captured per event
- Old + new values stored as JSON for full change history

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- MySQL 8.x running locally (or use Docker)

### 1. Clone & install
```bash
git clone <repo-url> fttddwa
cd fttddwa
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/fttddwa_db"
JWT_SECRET="your-32-char-secret-here-changeme!!"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="another-32-char-refresh-secret!!"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="exactly-32-chars-for-aes256-key!"
```

### 3. Setup database
```bash
# Create the database in MySQL first:
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE fttddwa_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed roles, permissions, and super admin user
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Default login:**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `admin@fttddwa.org` |
| Password | `Admin@123456` |

> **Change the default password immediately after first login.**

---

## Vercel + SiteGround Deployment

The recommended production setup is **Vercel** (hosting) + **SiteGround** (MySQL database).

### 1. Provision the database on SiteGround
1. In cPanel → **MySQL Databases**: create a database and user.
2. In cPanel → **Remote MySQL**: add `%` to allow Vercel connections.
3. Import `database/database.sql` via phpMyAdmin — this creates all 15 tables in one shot.
4. Run the seed script once (locally, pointing at SiteGround):
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@sg-host:3306/dbname?ssl={\"rejectUnauthorized\":false}" npm run db:seed
   ```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
1. Push code to GitHub and connect the repo in the Vercel dashboard.
2. Go to **Storage → Create → Blob store** and copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`.
3. Set environment variables in Vercel project settings:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `mysql://user:pass@sg-host:3306/dbname?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":false}&connection_limit=5` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | 32+ random chars |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | 32+ random chars |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | exactly 32 chars |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | (Optional) Path to storage |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |
| `MEMBERSHIP_ID_PREFIX` | `FTTD` |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` |
| `TIMEZONE` | `Asia/Kolkata` |

4. Deploy — Vercel runs `npm run build` (`prisma generate && next build`) automatically.

### 3. WhatsApp cron via n8n
The WhatsApp greeting cron is triggered by calling the public endpoint:
```
POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/whatsapp/cron/trigger
```
Add an HTTP Request node in n8n scheduled at **09:00 IST (03:30 UTC)** daily.

> **Worker note**: The background worker process (`worker.ts`) cannot run on Vercel. For WhatsApp job processing (sending queued messages), run the worker on a separate persistent server pointing at the same SiteGround database.

## Association Branding & Signatures

> [!TIP]
> **Logo & Signatures:**
> - **Logos:** Both Primary and Secondary logos should be **1080x1080px** (Max 1MB).
> - **Signatures:** Use images with a transparent background (PNG) or clean white background. For best results on ID cards, use a horizontal orientation (Max 500KB). **Resolution is automatically standardized to 650x300px.**

## File Storage & Persistent Volumes

The application uses environment-aware storage paths to handle file uploads (photos, signatures, branding).

### Environment-Based Paths
- **Development**: Files are stored in the `uploads/` folder in the project root.
- **Production**: Files default to `/app/persist/uploads`.
- **Custom Override**: You can override these by setting the `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable to an absolute path.

### Configuring Persistent Volumes (Coolify/Docker)
To ensure uploaded files are not lost during redeployments, you **must** mount a persistent volume.

**Mount Point:**
- **Destination Path**: `/app/persist/uploads`

In Coolify, go to **Storage → Volumes** and add a mount to this path.

## Production Deployment (VPS / Panel with PM2)

### 1. Initial Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run worker:build
npm run db:migrate:prod
```

### 2. Start with PM2
```bash
npm run prod:start   # Start both Next.js + Worker via PM2
npm run prod:status  # Check status
```

In your server panel, select `ecosystem.config.js` as the PM2 startup file.

## Script Environment Reference

| Use Case | Environment File | Priority |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Local Development** | `.env.local` | Highest (via `dotenv-cli`) |
| **Production (Standard / VPS)** | `.env` | Default |
| **Production (Vercel / Panel)** | System / Dashboard Env Vars | Top Priority |

- [ ] Change the default admin password
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (configure SSL in `docker/nginx/ssl/`)
- [ ] Set `APP_ENV=production` and `TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata`
- [ ] Configure a firewall — only expose ports 80 and 443
- [ ] Enable automated MySQL backups
- [ ] Review and rotate JWT secrets periodically
- [ ] Set up log monitoring

---

## Future Roadmap

- [x] ID card generation with single-use PDF token (membership card PDF)
- [x] QR code embed on ID card for offline verification
- [ ] SMS/Email notification system (OTP, renewal alerts)
- [ ] Payment integration (annual membership fee)
